# PMM Dump Documentation

The `pmm_dump` client utility performs a logical backup of the performance metrics, collected by the PMM Server and imports them into a different PMM Server instance.

PMM Dump allows you to share monitoring data, collected by your PMM server, with Percona Support team securely.
