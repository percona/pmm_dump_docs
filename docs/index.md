# PMM Dump Documentation

The `pmm-dump` client utility performs a logical backup of the performance metrics, collected by the PMM Server and imports them into a different PMM Server instance.

PMM Dump allows you to share monitoring data, collected by your PMM server, with Percona Support team securely.

    Starting with PMM 2.41, the standalone client utility is also available straight from PMM, and you can access it from the main menu **> Help > PMM Dump**.

    For a better user experience, we recommend generating PMM Dump datasets from the PMM built-in version. For more information, check out the [PMM Dump topic in the PMM documentation](https://docs.percona.com/percona-monitoring-and-management/how-to/PMM_dump.html).
